      <h1>We’re imagining a combination of two products; a slim solar powered bracelet and a reciever that children can use to register attendance. We’re calling it the EduBrace.</h1>

      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>The students receive the EduBrace on the first day of school. Each day when they enter school they would register their attendance at a receiver with the EduBrace, 
        as well as when they leave. 
        If they don’t show up it can get registered in the system and when the data is collected and reviewed there would be possibilities to notice trends over time. 
        Parents or guardians would also be notified by text message if the child is absent from school(would require tele coverage) by an automated service. 
        Depending the existing infrastructure, this might not be able to be on the same day, but it would still be a way to get that information out to the adults in their lives. 
        Then one can look through the data and see if there are any patterns with age, where they live or gender. 
        For example if there is a natural disaster in one area, the students from that area might not come to school, and that would be all registered.

      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <p>The information you get from the attendance and enrollment data opens up the opportunity to provide targeted follow-up on individual students as well as larger trends. 
        You would then be in a better position to more easily catch those who are about to permanently drop out of the school system and help them.
      </p>
      <p>The EduBrace could be able to collect more detailed data about students, and possibilities to use this data to identify broader themes or problems regarding school attendance.
        Further development of the automated sms system would also allow for people to give responses as to why they where unable to attend, 
        helping in the data collection and mapping of the issues.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Runs on a solar panel; no need for a consistent power supply or batteries. Possible to use in areas without access to reliable infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          An RFID chip inside the bracelet would contain the students individual number, as well as data about the child's age, gender and region where they live. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The receiver would also run on solar power, similar to solutions like solar powered parking meters. 
          The children would put the bracelet up to the receiver to register their attendance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reusable and reprogrammable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The data collected will be possible to transmit by satellite to avoid issues with a lack of stable telecommunications.
        </li>
        <li>
          May be easy to get started with, as it does not require developing new technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Requires little human resources to maintain once set up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Environmentally friendly and energy-saving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can be cheap to produce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reusable, and easy to reprogram.
        </li>
        <li>
